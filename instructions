# Comments allow you to write in english without being seen as code in python.
# As a beginner programmer it is a good habit to incorporate comments to your code for clarity and readability.
# Use the hash mark (#) to start a comment.
# When writing comments describe what your code does and how it works.
# Keep the comments and code simple.
